## When to Use Neo4j Memory Tools

Automatically activate memory tools for:

### Memory Operations

- **Context building**: Storing conversation context, project details, user preferences
- **Relationship mapping**: Connecting related concepts, people, or events
- **Knowledge retrieval**: Finding previously stored information
- **Pattern recognition**: Identifying connections across memories

### Tool Categories

**Creation Tools:**

- `create_entities` - Store new concepts, people, or things
- `create_relations` - Link entities with typed relationships
- `add_observations` - Attach facts or properties to entities

**Retrieval Tools:**

- `read_graph` - Visualize entire memory structure
- `search_memories` - Query across all stored information
- `find_memories_by_name` - Locate specific entities

**Maintenance Tools:**

- `delete_entities` - Remove outdated entities
- `delete_relations` - Unlink connections
- `delete_observations` - Clear properties

## Memory Patterns

**Building Context:**
Create entities for main concepts
Add observations about each entity
Create relations between related entities
Query to retrieve full context

**Tracking Projects:**

Create project entity
Add team member entities
Create "WORKS_ON" relations
Add observations for progress/status
Search for project updates

## Concrete Trigger Examples

User says: "Remember that John is the project lead for Alpha"
→ Use: `create_entities(["John", "Project Alpha"])` → `create_relations("John", "LEADS", "Project Alpha")`

User asks: "What do you know about the marketing campaign?"
→ Use: `search_memories("marketing campaign")` → Present connected information

User says: "Connect the budget discussion to Q4 planning"
→ Use: `find_memories_by_name("budget discussion")` → `create_relations("budget discussion", "RELATES_TO", "Q4 planning")`

## Graph Thinking

Structure memories as graphs:

- **Entities**: Nouns (people, places, things, concepts)
- **Relations**: Verbs (KNOWS, OWNS, MANAGES, INCLUDES)
- **Observations**: Adjectives/Properties (status: active, priority: high)

## Integration Rule

Use memory tools to:

- Maintain context across conversations
- Build accumulated knowledge
- Discover non-obvious connections
- Provide personalized responses based on history

Remember: Graph memories create richer context than linear storage.
