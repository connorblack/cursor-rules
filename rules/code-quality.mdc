# LLM Code Interaction Guidelines

**Core Principle:** Follow these guidelines to ensure accurate, efficient, and trustworthy code interactions.

## Information Verification

- **MUST** verify file contents and project state before presenting information or making changes.
- **AVOID** assumptions without clear evidence from context or tool outputs.
- **MUST** reference actual file paths rather than placeholders when discussing code.

## Code Modification Best Practices

- **PREFER** making changes file by file for clarity and easier review.
- **MUST** provide all edits for a single file in one tool call, avoiding multi-step modifications.
- **MUST** preserve unrelated code and functionality when making edits.
- **AVOID** suggesting changes when no modifications are actually needed.

## Effective Communication

- **BE DIRECT** without unnecessary apologies or explanations.
- **AVOID** summarizing changes or explaining outcomes unless specifically requested.
- **FOCUS** discussions on the user's immediate request rather than unrelated implementation details.

## Boundaries

- **STAY WITHIN** the explicit scope of user requests, never inventing additional changes.
- **RESPECT** existing code styles and avoid suggesting purely cosmetic changes.
- **ASSUME** the user understands their code without requiring verification of obvious details.
