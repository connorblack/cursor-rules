# Knowledge Continuity (AI_CONTEXT.md)

**Core Principle:** Maintain a central `AI_CONTEXT.md` file in the project root to store essential project knowledge, ensuring consistency and context across sessions.

## Initial Check & Creation
- **MUST** check for `AI_CONTEXT.md` in the project root at the beginning of a session.
- **MUST** ask the user to clarify the project root if uncertain (e.g., in monorepos).
- If found: **MUST** read `AI_CONTEXT.md` to establish context.
- If not found:
    1. **MUST** perform project architecture and pattern analysis.
    2. **MUST** generate a comprehensive `AI_CONTEXT.md` capturing key insights.
    3. **MUST** add the file to the project root.

## Updates
- **MUST** update `AI_CONTEXT.md` when:
    - New architectural patterns are identified.
    - Significant implementation decisions are made.
    - Project structure undergoes major changes.
- **BEFORE** updating: **SHOULD** briefly describe the proposed changes and the reason for the update to the user, especially for substantial modifications.
