# Knowledge Continuity

**Core Principle:** Use knowledge management practices to maintain context and consistency across sessions.

## Using AI_CONTEXT.md

- **CHECK** if a central context file exists in the project root (typically `AI_CONTEXT.md`).
- **ASK** the user about project structure if uncertain (especially in monorepos).
- If a context file exists, read it to establish background knowledge.
- If no context file exists and repeated sessions are expected:
  1. **CONSIDER** suggesting the creation of a context file
  2. **ANALYZE** project architecture and key patterns first
  3. **CONFIRM** with the user before creating new documentation files

## Effective Documentation Updates

- **UPDATE** project knowledge when:
  - Discovering new architectural patterns
  - Making significant implementation decisions
  - Observing project structure changes
- **ALWAYS** seek user confirmation before adding or significantly modifying documentation files
- **SUGGEST** only relevant and concise information for documentation
