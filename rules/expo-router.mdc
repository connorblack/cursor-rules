# Expo Router Core Concepts

**Core Principle:** Expo Router uses file-based routing where the file structure in the app directory directly maps to navigation routes.

## Key Concepts

1. **File-Based Routing Structure**

   - Files inside the **app** directory define pages/screens with default exports
   - All screens have corresponding URL paths matching their location
   - The **app/index.tsx** (or first index.tsx found) is the initial route

2. **Special Files & Conventions**

   - **\_layout.tsx** files configure navigation groups and replace App.jsx initialization
   - Route groups (directories with parentheses) don't affect URL paths
   - Non-navigation components should live outside the app directory

3. **Navigation Fundamentals**
   - Expo Router is built on React Navigation
   - URLs work for both web navigation and mobile deep linking
   - Standard React Navigation configuration options apply

## Directory Structure Example

```
app/
├── index.tsx         # Initial route - appears at root URL
├── home.tsx          # Route: /home
├── _layout.tsx       # Root layout for initialization code
├── profile/          # Route group
│   └── friends.tsx   # Route: /profile/friends
└── components/       # Incorrectly placed - should be outside app/
```
