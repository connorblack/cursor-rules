# Tool Usage Strategies

**Core Principle:** Use appropriate tools and sequences for efficiently gathering information, modifying code, and validating changes.

## Information Gathering

- **Project Exploration:** Build understanding of project structure

  - Start broad with directory listings
  - Read key files (READMEs, config files)
  - Search for specific patterns across the codebase
  - Analyze component relationships and dependencies

- **Effective Search Techniques:**
  - Use semantic search for concept-based exploration
  - Use grep for exact pattern matching
  - Combine search approaches to triangulate information

## Code Modification

- **Safe Transformation:** Modify code with confidence

  - Understand the code before changing it
  - Make minimal, focused edits
  - Validate changes incrementally
  - Preserve existing behavior and patterns

- **Iterative Development:** Build functionality step by step
  - Start with minimal implementation
  - Test core functionality
  - Enhance incrementally
  - Refactor and optimize

## Validation

- **Verify Correctness:** Ensure changes work as expected

  - Test against requirements
  - Verify edge cases
  - Confirm integration with other components

- **Prevent Regressions:** Maintain existing functionality
  - Run tests before and after changes
  - Focus on potential impact areas
  - Verify unchanged behavior
