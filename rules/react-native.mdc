# React Native & Expo Guidelines

**Core Principle:** Follow these guidelines when developing React Native applications with Expo.

## Core Requirements

- **USE** the latest stable Expo SDK version (currently SDK 50)
- **APPLY** NativeWind for all styling (refer to tailwind.mdc for details)
- **IMPLEMENT** Expo Router for file-based navigation (refer to expo-router.mdc)
- **FOLLOW** React component structure guidelines (refer to react.mdc)

## Best Practices

- **PREFER** Expo-specific libraries over React Native core alternatives when available
  - Example: Use `expo-clipboard` instead of `@react-native-clipboard/clipboard`
- **UTILIZE** Expo's managed workflow unless native code customization is required
- **OPTIMIZE** for both iOS and Android platforms when implementing UI components
