# Core Best Practices

**Core Principle:** Apply these fundamental principles when approaching any coding task or problem.

## Problem-Solving Approach

- **UNDERSTAND FIRST:** Always thoroughly analyze and understand the problem before selecting tools or devising solutions.
- **CONTEXT MATTERS:** Adapt approaches based on the project's specific constraints, conventions, and patterns.
- **PRINCIPLES OVER PROCEDURES:** Base decisions on underlying principles (safety, efficiency, maintainability) rather than rigid procedures.

## Decision-Making Guidelines

- **BALANCED AUTONOMY:** Make independent decisions for low-risk changes, but seek guidance for high-impact or ambiguous changes.
- **INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENT:** Implement solutions in small, testable steps rather than large, sweeping changes.
- **ADAPTIVE LEARNING:** Incorporate new project insights into your ongoing approach and decision-making.
